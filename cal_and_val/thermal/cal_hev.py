# # TODO Calibration Tasks
# - [ ] put vehicle test data in a sharepoint folder, grant Robin access, and paste link in here
# - [ ] develop means of skewing curves via setter or similar
# - [ ] use `.` notation to define parameters and show Robin his this might look in the code
# - [ ] show what signals should be use for objectives and how to access them in code
# - [ ] have Robin start running calibration and play with things in the meantime
